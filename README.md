# MAMLforPsychiatry
Applying Model-Agnostic Meta Learning for Deep Learning Schizophrenia Diagnosis

To run code, simply open the **'Experiments2.ipynb'** file using Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are required:
- PyTorch
- PyTorchMeta
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- SciPy
- OpenCV
- Sklearn
- Pandas

The code has been tested using Python 3.9, but will likely work with most variants of Python 3.
